# Question : React native assignment - Note taking app
Date - 19th Feb 2021
Build a simple note taking app with following set of features
1. Design the UI as per the wireframe below. (Good UI can get some extra points)
2. There should be 3 screens - Login, List and Add Note screens, respectively.
3. Persist username in asyncstorage and create a flow similar to which we did
during the session.
4. User should be able to add notes and delete them.
5. Persist notes as well.
